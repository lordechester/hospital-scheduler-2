## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

### 1.1 Check Your Project Structure
Make sure you have these files in your project:
```
Master Scheduler 2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vite.config.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 1.2 Test Your Build Locally
```bash
npm run build
```
This should create a `dist` folder with your built files.

   - **Description**: `Hospital Room Scheduling Application`
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (you already have one)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2.2 Push Your Code to GitHub
```bash
# Initialize git in your project folder
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Hospital Room Scheduler"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hospital-scheduler-2.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Access Your Live App

### 4.1 Get Your URL
After deployment, Vercel will give you:
- **Production URL**: `https://hospital-scheduler-2.vercel.app`
- **Preview URL**: `https://hospital-scheduler-2-git-main.vercel.app`

### 4.2 Test Your App
1. Click on the production URL
2. Test all features:
   - Month/Year selection
   - Day of week selection
   - Booking time slots
   - Editing bookings
   - Responsive design

---

## Step 5: Share for Feedback

### 5.1 Share the URL
Share your production URL with users:
```
https://hospital-scheduler-2.vercel.app
```

### 5.2 Create a Feedback Form
1. Go to [forms.google.com](https://forms.google.com)
2. Create a new form with questions like:
   - How easy was it to use?
   - What features would you like to see?
   - Any bugs or issues?
3. Add the form link to your app

---

## Step 6: Continuous Deployment

### 6.1 Automatic Updates
Every time you push to GitHub:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated feature"
   git push
   ```
3. Vercel automatically redeploys

### 6.2 Preview Deployments
- Each pull request gets a preview URL
- Test changes before merging to main

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
If you get build errors:
1. Check the Vercel logs
2. Test locally: `npm run build`
3. Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`

### Missing Files
If files aren't showing:
1. Check your `vite.config.ts`
2. Make sure `index.html` is in the root
3. Verify all imports are correct

### Performance Issues
- Vercel automatically optimizes your app
- Images are automatically optimized
- CDN is included

---

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### 6.1 Add Analytics
```bash
# Install Google Analytics
npm install react-ga
```

### 6.2 Monitor Performance
- Vercel provides built-in analytics
- Check Core Web Vitals
- Monitor page load times

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### After Deployment:
1. **Test thoroughly** on different devices
2. **Collect user feedback** using the form
3. **Monitor performance** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Iterate** based on feedback
5. **Add features** as needed

### Useful Vercel Features:
- **Custom Domains**: Add your own domain

## üéâ Success!

Once deployed, your app will be available at:
```
https://hospital-scheduler-2.vercel.app
```

Share this URL with your users to collect feedback! 

## üöÄ **Next Steps for Deployment**

Since Git was just installed, you'll need to **restart your terminal/PowerShell** for the changes to take effect. Here's what to do:

### **Step 1: Restart Your Terminal**
1. Close your current PowerShell/terminal window
2. Open a new PowerShell window
3. Navigate back to your project:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\robdo\Cursor Projects\Master Scheduler 2"
   ```

### **Step 2: Verify Git Installation**
```powershell
git --version
```
You should see something like: `git version 2.50.1.windows.1`

### **Step 3: Initialize Git Repository**
```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Hospital Room Scheduler"
```

### **Step 4: Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** button ‚Üí **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `hospital-scheduler-2`
4. Make it **Public**
5. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### **Step 5: Connect to GitHub**
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hospital-scheduler-2.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 6: Deploy to Vercel**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Import your `hospital-scheduler-2` repository
5. Click **"Deploy"**

‚úÖ **Automatic updates** when you push to GitHub
‚úÖ **HTTPS security** included
‚úÖ **Global CDN** for fast loading
‚úÖ **Analytics** in Vercel dashboard

---

##  **After Deployment**

Once your app is live, you can:
1. **Share the URL** with hospital staff for feedback
2. **Test on mobile devices** to ensure responsiveness
3. **Create a feedback form** using Google Forms
4. **Monitor usage** in Vercel dashboard

**Would you like me to help you with any specific step, or do you have questions about the deployment process?**

The key is restarting your terminal first so Git becomes available, then following the steps above. Your hospital scheduling app will be live and ready for user feedback! üè•‚ú®
